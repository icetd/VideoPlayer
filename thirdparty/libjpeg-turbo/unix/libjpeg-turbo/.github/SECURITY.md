# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Fixes for security vulnerabilities are applied to any applicable branch/release
series that is in the
[Next-Gen, Active, Maintenance, or Extended support category](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported in one of the following ways:

- [E-mail the project admin](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/About/Contact).  You can
  optionally encrypt the e-mail using the provided public GPG key.
- Open a
  [GitHub draft security advisory](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/security/advisories/new).
- [Alpha/Evolving, Beta, and Post-Beta release series](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning)
  are not expected to be free of bugs, so vulnerabilities that affect only
  those release series (for example, vulnerabilities introduced by a new
  feature that is not present in a Stable release series) can optionally be
  reported using a
  [GitHub bug report](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/new/choose).
